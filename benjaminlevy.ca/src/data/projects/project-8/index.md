title: "In Data we Trust"
description: "Submission to the St. Gallen Symposium 2020 essay competition. Although the symposium was delayed due to the global pandemic, this essay was chosen for publication in a collection of notable submissions. I advocate for the use of data trusts to protect user privacy in a digital, data-driven age."
