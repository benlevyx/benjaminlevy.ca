I spent the summer of 2020 as an intern on the Facebook News team in New York City. Well, technically it was in Toronto because all internships were remote that summer (something to do with a global pandemic). I analyzed massive datasets and built beautiful data visualizations to better understand the news producer ecosystem across Facebook.
