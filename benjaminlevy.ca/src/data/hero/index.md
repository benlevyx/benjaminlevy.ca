content: "Hey there! I'm Ben. Let me tell you about myself. I'm a data scientist who likes to build things with data that are fun to use, insightful, and make people want to learn more. I recently completed my Master's of Data Science at Harvard University, based in the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Since February 2021, I've been at QuantumBlack, part of McKinsey & Co., in Boston, MA, where I've been learning as much as possible as a Data Science Fellow.
