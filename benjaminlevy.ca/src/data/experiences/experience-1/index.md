Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) works with governments, non-profits, and social enterprises around the world (especially Sub-Saharan Africa) to help extract value for society from data. In my summer there, I worked with satellite data to build a machine learning model that could identify cashew farms from the sky and predict their annual yield, aiding local governments with food security surveillance.
