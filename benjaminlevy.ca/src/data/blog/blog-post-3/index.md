I got involved with the COVID-19 Student Response Team at the Harvard Medical School during the Harvard spring break. Although I initially planned on building some interactive data visualizations to helpe people understand the epidemiological data surrounding COVID-19 (still hoping to do some of that), I quickly got enlisted to create a standalone website for the entire team, centralizing the team's social media content, in-depth medical curriculum, and constellation of activism initiatives. In this post I want to briefly sketch how I set up in the website in less than a week, detailing the tools I used and the tricks I learned along the way.
